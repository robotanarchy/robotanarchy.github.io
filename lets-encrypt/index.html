			  <span class="post-date">Saturday, 2015-11-07</span>
			      <p>Previously this blog simply used a self signed certificate, because I knew that <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let&rsquo;s Encrypt</a>  was about to be released later this year. Of course, this means, that every time anyone has visited the blog, that person would see a big scary warning message, that the connection is not trustworthy.</p>

<p>So two days ago, I got a e-mail titled &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s Encrypt Closed Beta Invite&rdquo;, which told me that I may try to obtain my certificate now. That is, because I&rsquo;ve taken part in the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/lets-encrypt-enters-private-beta">private beta</a> program, that they have launched. If you&rsquo;d like to join, in the EFF article I&rsquo;ve linked is a link to some <em>Google Forms</em> (that&rsquo;s a bit scary from a privacy point of view!) document, where you can type in your e-mail address and the domain(s) you would like to register. I did that a few weeks ago, I think.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not really running a mainstream distribution or webserver and know how to install a certificate myself. So I&rsquo;ve decided to go with <a href="https://github.com/diafygi/letsencrypt-nosudo">letsencrypt-nosudo</a> from Github. As with the official letsencrypt client, it requires python2. The source code is slightly less than 400 SLOC, so I could read through it before using it.</p>

<p>The only thing I&rsquo;d like to see improved is a version that doesn&rsquo;t need python (or any other dependency) at all, so it fits better in sabotage&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/sabotage-linux/sabotage/wiki/Project-Goals">philosophy</a> (see minimal bloat section). Someone asked <a href="https://github.com/letsencrypt/acme-spec/issues/67">here</a> for a version with CLI-tools only, but was told that this isn&rsquo;t practical due to <em>JSON Web Signatures</em>, which aren&rsquo;t implemented in any such tools. However, the protocol is open and maybe some day someone will write a tiny C client, that does the same thing as the python script above (assisting you in getting the certificate, not messing with your configs).</p>

<p><em>Back to topic.</em> Let&rsquo;s Encrypt is really awesome and everyone should use it, who doesn&rsquo;t have a valid certificate yet (or even worse, is hosting their services <em>without</em> TLS)! And the automatic installation and configuration in HTTP daemons is a good thing for most people, because it will really spread the usage of TLS, improving peoples privacy a bit every time.</p>

<p>It works!</p>
