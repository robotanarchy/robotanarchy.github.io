			      <p>No, this post is <em>not</em> about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalin">radical dictator</a> whose regime is responsible for the death of millions of people. If you&rsquo;re like me, that idea pops directly into your head when you read about <em>stali</em>.</p>

<p>The only connection from the above to what I&rsquo;m writing about today may be the word <em>radical</em>. It&rsquo;s <a href="http://suckless.org">suckless.org</a>&rsquo;s very own Linux distribution: <a href="http://sta.li">stali</a>, which stands for static linux. They link <strong>everything</strong> statically, and besides that, do everything you would expect from their <a href="http://suckless.org/philosophy">philosopy</a> (which is ideogically not far away from <a href="/about">my own</a> as you may have noticed): No systemd, musl libc, better security and relieability through minimalism and what not. What really stands out in 2016 is using <code>git</code> as binary package manager. Here is <a href="http://sta.li/upgrade">their version</a> of <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman_rosetta"><code>pacman -Syu</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>; sudo su
# cd /
# git pull
</code></pre>

<p>Stali is quite old actually, from their front page it looks like they have revised their goals in 2010 (so it is even older) &ndash; and for a very long time they have had nothing to show from the distribution, except for their interesting ideas. In the meantime, <a href="http://sabotage.tech/">sabotage</a> appeared with similar goals (that&rsquo;s the operating system running on this very webserver) and I thought stali would have more or less set the ideas for sabotage and that&rsquo;s it &ndash; they would not go anywhere.</p>

<p>But I was wrong, there has finally been a release of stali this month (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/4eg0sw/stali_linux_sees_its_first_public_prerelease/">reddit</a>, <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/3048737/open-source-tools/stali-distribution-smashes-assumptions-about-linux.html">infoworld</a>)! This distro is certainly not for averange Ubuntu Joe, but if you&rsquo;re either looking for a minimal Linux kernel based operating system or want to learn about interesting design decisions in order to create one yourself, <strong><a href="http://sta.li">go check it out!</a></strong></p>
